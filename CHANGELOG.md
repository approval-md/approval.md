# Changelog

All notable changes to `approval-md`, the reference runtime for the approval.md
convention. Versions follow the package; the SPEC keeps its own amendment
markers.

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

The first release. Every milestone of SPEC.md section 14 (M0 to M8) is in it.

- **The policy file.** `APPROVAL.md` with one `yaml approval-policy` block:
  classes, six autonomy levels (`human-only`, `manual`, `supervised-live`,
  `supervised-retro`, `autonomous`, and the `supervised` alias), budgets,
  protected paths, the irreversibility floor, and attestation by content.
- **The log.** An append-only, hash-chained `events.jsonl` with schema
  validation at the write boundary, compare-and-append under concurrency,
  `log verify`, `log sync` and `log advance`, and conformance vectors a second
  implementation can run.
- **The gate.** `register`, `request`, `wait`, `grant`, `reject`, `revoke`,
  `withdraw`, `expire`; single-use execution tokens bound to payload bytes,
  delivered by hand or sealed to a per-request key; `run` and the adapter
  contract, with SMTP and AgentMail adapters that open a credential only inside
  a verified token window.
- **Channels.** Telegram (tap on a phone), a local web queue page, and the CLI.
- **Harness hooks.** `approval hook claude-code` and `approval hook cursor`
  classify every shell command and file edit a coding agent issues and answer
  from the policy; `approval mcp serve` exposes the agent surface over MCP,
  with a guest mode.
- **The daemon.** `approval up` runs the watch loop and every channel in one
  process: TTL expiry, retrospective sampling with an operator-held secret,
  loop escalation, projection write-back, and the log-advance cadence.
- **Retrospective review.** `audit list`, `audit review`, reconciliation
  obligations for a denied action, and human-signed checkpoints.
- **Both directions of "approval".** The journal (`journal write`) is the
  agent's ungated outlet; the values block (`approval values`) and graded
  reactions (`approval feedback`) are the human's, and neither reaches
  enforcement (SPEC section 11.1, invariant 10).
- **Interop.** Backlog.md task files carry the approval envelope with byte
  round-trip fidelity; `import agents-md` drafts a policy and a values block
  from AGENTS.md prose.
- **Diagnostics.** `doctor`, `status`, `coverage`, `policy check`, `policy
  test`, and machine-readable `--json` on every verb with the schemas printed
  by `instructions --schemas`.
- **A hook timeout neither floods the phone nor feeds the escalation**
  (APRV-287). An expired wait keeps its question open for a retry grace
  (`--retry-grace`, default 5 minutes) and then withdraws it with reason
  `timeout`, so a tap on it authorizes nothing and says so; a listener starting
  or reconnecting collapses the requests older than that line into one message
  with a single reject-all instead of one message each; the several classes of
  one command are delivered as one card with one approve, with the command's
  bytes sent once; an expired wait and a harness-side misfire are not executions
  and accrue no loop-safety streak; and a completed command clears the floor
  even when the grant it ran on was carried by a later tool call.
- **The CI guard's dependency floor reads the install Node would read**
  (APRV-298). The case that proves every production dependency admits the Node
  floor used to join the repository root to a literal `node_modules`, so running
  the suite from an agent worktree, which has none of its own, failed with
  ENOENT and reported a missing install as a violated floor. It now resolves
  each dependency's `package.json` the way module resolution does, walking up
  from the test file, and skips by name when a package is absent from every
  `node_modules` on that path. A manifest that does not name the package it
  claims to be fails the case, which keeps `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from
  answering with the `dist/cjs` stub its wildcard export maps the subpath to.

The publish itself is the first `release.publish` action to pass through this
gate (APRV-199).
